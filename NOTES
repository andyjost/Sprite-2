  - I tried implementing path compression over FWD nodes to improve
    wheel_sieve2.  The average path length is only 1.79 (among paths with FWD
    nodes) and, overall, preformance degrades.

  - By running GC diagnostics, I determined that wheel_sieve2 uses an
    ever-increasing amount of memory.  I tried adjusting the gc threshold to
    improve performance.  A setting of 50% had essentially no effect, so I
    abandoned the effort.

  - Enabling SPRITE_OPTIMIZE_IF_EXPR (config:amj) does improve the performance
    of wheel_sieve2, but only by about 25%.

        Running on galapagos.
