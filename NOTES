  - I tried implementing path compression over FWD nodes to improve
    wheel_sieve2.  The average path length is only 1.79 (among paths with FWD
    nodes) and, overall, preformance degrades.

  - By running GC diagnostics, I determined that wheel_sieve2 uses an
    ever-increasing amount of memory.  I tried adjusting the gc threshold to
    improve performance.  A setting of 50% had essentially no effect, so I
    abandoned the effort.

  - Enabling SPRITE_OPTIMIZE_IF_EXPR (config:amj) does improve the performance
    of wheel_sieve2, but only by about 25%.

        Running on galapagos.

  - Here are a few ideas to improve core performance.
    
    - Switch from the dt() method to explicit goto statements.

    - Eliminate the use of at() in cases where the type is known.

    - Use a global register for the head of the free list.

    - Measure the relative time for pattern matching and rewriting to guide
      optimization.

  - Do in-place successors actually help?  How much?  It would be nice if the indexing
    rules were more consistent.

  - It seems the definitions of math operators can be tightened up.
