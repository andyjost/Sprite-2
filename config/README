Overview
========

This directory contains a variety of predefined build configurations.

base-config supplies common definitions, and you will likely need to modify it
to provide a path to the Boost libraries on your system.


Config File Requirements
========================

A config file is a BASH program sourced from scripts/make-benchmarks.  It must
define the variables CFLAGS and INCLUDE:

  CFLAGS
      Provides all options passes to the compiler.

  INCLUDE
      Must provide the -I declaration(s) needed to use the Boost libraries
      (version 1.48 or later).


Sprite Build Options
====================

There are several Sprite-specific options that may be added to CFLAGS as -D
options to the compiler.  They are:

  TRACING
      Traces every step taken during execution.

  SPRITE_GC_MODE
      Selects the garbage collection mode.  Possible values are:
          0
              Use reference counting.
          1
              Use gargabe collection (default).
          2
              Use crosschecked garbage collection; keep the reference count and
              assert that it is zero every time a node is reclaimed by the
              collector.

  SPRITE_EXEC_MODE
      Selects the execution strategy.  Possible values are:
          0
              Use the "function-table" strategy, which relies on a table of
              function addresses and function calls for pattern matching
              (default).
          1
              Use the "label-table" strategy, which relies on a table of jump
              labels and goto* for pattern matching.

  TRACEREFS
      Traces every change to a reference count.

  TRACEALLOC
      Traces every allocation and deallocation event.

  TRACEGC
      Traces the operation of the garbage collector.  Possible values are:

          1
              Print statistics about the collection event every time the
              collector is run.

          2
              Trace every mark made during the MARK phase of collection.  Also
              does everything a value of 1 would do.

  SPRITE_OPTIMIZE_IF_EXPR
      Enables special handling of if-then-else expressions to improve
      performance.

  SPRITE_NO_REGISTER_FREE_LIST
      Places the head of the node free list into a normal variable rather than
      a dedicated register.
