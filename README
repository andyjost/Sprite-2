Package Contents
================

The following directories are included in the distribution:

    benchmarks
        Contains source code for benchmark programs.

    bin
        Contains executable programs.

    config
        Contains configuration files to control build settings.

    scripts
        Contains scripts for building and such.

    sprite
        Contains Sprite include files.

    src
        Contains Sprite source files.


Running Benchmarks
==================

Two scripts are used to build and run the benchmarks:

    scripts/make-benchmarks
        Builds benchmark programs and places them under bin.

    scripts/run-benchmarks
        Runs benchmark programs and reports timing info.

Examples
--------

Build and run optimized code with reference counting::

    % scripts/make-benchmarks -c refcnt-opt -q reverse tak
    % scripts/run-benchmarks -s reverse tak
    reverse              0:01.81
    tak                  0:01.07

Build and run optimized code with garbage collection::

    % scripts/make-benchmarks -c gc-opt -q reverse tak
    % scripts/run-benchmarks -s reverse tak
    reverse              0:00.80
    tak                  0:01.20
